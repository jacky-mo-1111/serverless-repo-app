okk I see, I need to add a lot more before commiting everything. 
I am Jacky, I have been taking CS introductory courses for the past two years, including object oriented programming, data structure and programming courses. I can program in C++ and Python proficiently. Besides, I took part in GRID Hackathon and worked as one of the software engineers in the team. We train a XGBoost model to predict goods demand for grocery stores in order to prevent food waste. 

I once was a business student. In my previous summer, I have worked as Equity Research Summer Analyst for Diamond Equity Research in New York. At Diamond Equity Research, I built and updated financial models and performed industry research for companies including MIND Technology (NASDAQ: MIND), Global Ship Lease (NYSE: GSL), and Harbor Custom Development (NASDAQ: HCDI). Also, I worked on buy/sell/hold recommendations for preferred stock new issues, created client briefs for preferred deals through offering memorandums, and offered my thoughts in bullet points to management

I am a huge football fan. I was the president and captain of the American Football Club in my high school, leading the team to get the city's first championship in our team history. In addition, to build our team's fund, I obtained corporate sponsorship for over $5000 from 2 large sponsors and negotiated long-term supporting packages. I also created a class on American football to teach it to an underclassman, which attracted dozens of students. My football experience helped build my communication and leadership skills, realizing how passionate I can be for the work I like. 

I hope you will consider my candidacy. If you have any questions about my candidacy, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I hope you have a fantastic rest of the week, and looking forward to hearing from you.
